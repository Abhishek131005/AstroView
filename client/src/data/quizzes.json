      {
        "question": "What is the point in Earth's orbit where it is closest to the Sun called?",
        "options": ["Aphelion", "Perihelion", "Perigee", "Apogee"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Perihelion is when Earth is closest to the Sun (around January 3rd). Aphelion is when we're farthest away. Perigee and apogee refer to distances from Earth, not the Sun."
      },
      {
        "question": "What causes a meteor to appear as a streak of light in the sky?",
        "options": ["It's a falling star", "It's burning up in Earth's atmosphere", "It's reflecting sunlight", "It's a laser from aliens"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Meteors are small pieces of space debris that burn up due to friction when entering Earth's atmosphere at high speed. The bright streak is caused by the intense heat, not reflection or falling stars (stars don't fall!)."
      },

        "question": "How long does it take the International Space Station to orbit Earth once?",
        "options": ["24 hours", "12 hours", "90 minutes", "45 minutes"],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "The ISS completes one orbit around Earth every 90 minutes, traveling at about 28,000 km/h (17,500 mph). This means astronauts see 16 sunrises and sunsets every day!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a light year?",
        "options": ["A year on a planet with lots of light", "The time it takes light to travel around Earth", "The distance light travels in one year", "365 days of daylight"],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "A light year is a unit of distance, not time. It's the distance light travels in one year - about 9.46 trillion kilometers! It's used to measure the vast distances between stars."
      },
      {
        "question": "What are the Northern and Southern Lights (auroras) caused by?",
        "options": ["Reflected moonlight", "Solar wind particles hitting Earth's atmosphere", "Light pollution", "Volcanic eruptions"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Auroras are created when charged particles from the solar wind collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere near the poles. These collisions create beautiful curtains of colorful light."

        "question": "What force keeps satellites in orbit around Earth?",
        "options": ["Magnetism", "Air pressure", "Gravity", "Rocket thrust"],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "Gravity is the invisible force that keeps satellites in orbit. A satellite is constantly falling toward Earth, but it's also moving sideways fast enough that it keeps missing Earth - that's an orbit!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What is a geostationary orbit?",
        "options": ["An orbit around a statue", "An orbit that stays above the same spot on Earth", "An orbit that goes around the equator", "An orbit at ground level"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A geostationary orbit is 35,786 km above the equator where a satellite moves at exactly the same speed as Earth's rotation, appearing to hover over one spot. Perfect for communication and weather satellites!"
      },

        "question": "If you're in a spacecraft orbiting Earth, what keeps you weightless?",
        "options": ["There's no gravity in space", "You're constantly falling", "Anti-gravity technology", "You're too far from Earth"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Weightlessness in orbit isn't because there's no gravity - it's because you and your spacecraft are constantly falling toward Earth together. This creates the sensation of weightlessness, also called microgravity."
      },
      {
        "question": "What happens to a satellite's speed as it gets closer to Earth?",
        "options": ["It slows down", "It speeds up", "It stays the same", "It stops moving"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Satellites move faster when they're closer to Earth due to stronger gravitational pull. The ISS at 400 km altitude moves at 28,000 km/h, while the Moon at 384,000 km moves at only 3,700 km/h."

        "options": ["How long an orbit lasts", "The time it takes to complete one orbit", "The shape of an orbit", "The speed of an orbit"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Orbital period is the time it takes for an object to complete one full orbit around another object. Earth's orbital period around the Sun is 365.25 days; the Moon's orbital period around Earth is about 27.3 days."

        "options": ["Size", "Composition", "Orbit shape", "Color"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Asteroids are rocky and metallic, while comets are made of ice, dust, and rock. When comets get close to the Sun, their ice evaporates creating a glowing tail - asteroids don't do this!"
      },
      {
        "question": "Where is the asteroid belt located?",
        "options": ["Between Earth and Mars", "Between Mars and Jupiter", "Between Jupiter and Saturn", "Beyond Neptune"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,

        "question": "What causes seasons on Earth?",
        "options": ["Distance from the Sun", "Earth's axial tilt", "Solar flares", "The Moon's gravity"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Earth's 23.5° axial tilt causes seasons. When the Northern Hemisphere tilts toward the Sun, it's summer there and winter in the Southern Hemisphere. Distance from the Sun plays a very small role."
      },

        "question": "What is a meteorite?",
        "options": ["A meteor that's very bright", "A meteor shower", "A meteor that reaches the ground", "A small comet"],
        "correctAnswer": 2,
        "explanation": "A meteorite is a piece of rock or metal from space that survives passing through Earth's atmosphere and lands on the surface. Most meteors burn up completely, but some make it through!"

        "options": ["Earth", "The Moon", "Mars", "A comet"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "A solar eclipse occurs when the Moon passes between Earth and the Sun, blocking the Sun's light. The Moon is 400 times smaller than the Sun but also 400 times closer, making them appear the same size!"
      },
      {
        "question": "What color is most commonly seen in auroras (Northern/Southern Lights)?",
        "options": ["Red", "Green", "Blue", "Purple"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Green is the most common aurora color, created when solar wind particles collide with oxygen molecules at altitudes of 100-300 km. Red auroras occur at higher altitudes, while blue and purple come from nitrogen."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Solar flares are sudden, intense bursts of radiation from the Sun's surface. Large flares can disrupt radio communications, GPS, and even power grids on Earth when directed our way."

        "question": "What is the darkest part of a shadow during an eclipse called?",
        "options": ["Penumbra", "Umbra", "Corona", "Chromosphere"],
        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "The umbra is the darkest part of a shadow where all direct light is blocked. During a total solar eclipse, only people in the Moon's umbra see the Sun completely covered."

        "correctAnswer": 1,
        "explanation": "Meteor showers occur when Earth passes through trails of debris left behind by comets. As these tiny particles enter our atmosphere at high speed, they burn up, creating multiple shooting stars!"
