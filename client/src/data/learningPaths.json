The very bright ones that don't twinkle are usually planets! Stars twinkle because their light passes through our turbulent atmosphere.",

Look for the Big Dipper (7 bright stars forming a ladle shape)\n2. Find the two stars at the edge of the Dipper's 'cup'\n3. Draw an imaginary line through these two stars\n4. Follow this line about 5 times the distance between them\n5. You'll reach a moderately bright star - that's Polaris!\n\n**Why It Matters:**\nFor centuries, travelers used Polaris for navigation. It's also at the end of the Little Dipper's handle. Try finding it tonight!",

Give your eyes 20-30 minutes to adjust to darkness\n2. Start with the brightest objects and work toward dimmer ones\n3. Look slightly to the side of faint objects (your peripheral vision is more sensitive)\n4. Be patient - the longer you observe, the more you'll see\n\n**Challenge:**\nGo out tonight and try to identify at least 3 constellations and 1 planet!",

They're in constant free-fall, which creates the weightless environment inside.\n\n**Orbital Altitudes:**\n- Low Earth Orbit (LEO): 200-2,000 km (ISS, Starlink)\n- Medium Earth Orbit (MEO): 2,000-35,786 km (GPS)\n- Geostationary Orbit (GEO): 35,786 km (weather, communications)",
